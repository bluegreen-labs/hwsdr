Dear CRAN team,

This is an update of the {hwsdr} package (version 1.1). This package provides easy downloads of 'HWSD' soil data directly to your R workspace.

The update now includes access to the latest version 2 database (in addition to the old v1.2). It further addresses the a citation formatting issue, and removes the dependency on the {raster} package.

Kind regards,
Koen Hufkens
